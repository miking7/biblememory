## What Works (When Migration Complete)

### ✅ Core Application (Phase 1 Mostly Complete)

#### Build System & Development
- Modern build pipeline with Vite 5.x
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast development
- Production builds optimized and ready for deployment
- PostCSS processing for Tailwind CSS
- **NEW:** Vue 3 with Single File Components

#### User Interface (Pre-Migration - To be restored)
- Beautiful glass-morphism design
- Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Tab navigation (Add Verse, My Verses, Review)
- Modal dialogs for editing
- Offline indicator
- Loading states and feedback
- Search and filter functionality
- Unicode-insensitive search (handles accented characters)
- Search within tags (keys and values)
- Context-aware empty states (distinguishes no verses vs. no search results)
- Tag display in My Verses (footer with metadata) and Review (inline with translation)
- Translation badge inline with verse title in My Verses

#### Data Management
- IndexedDB storage via Dexie.js (7 tables)
- Verse CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Multi-paragraph verse support
- Structured tags system
- Translation field
- Favorite flag
- Reference sorting (refSort field)

#### Review System
- Spaced repetition algorithm
  - Learn phase (< 7 days): Daily review
  - Daily phase (7-56 days): Daily review
  - Weekly phase (56-112 days): 1-in-7 probability
  - Monthly phase (112+ days): 1-in-30 probability
- Review mode (reference → reveal content)
- "Got it!" vs "Need Practice" feedback
- Review history tracking
- Due count badge on Review tab

#### Offline-First Architecture
- Full functionality without internet
- Operations queued in outbox when offline
- Automatic sync when connection restored
- IndexedDB provides unlimited storage
- No data loss during offline periods

#### Sync Infrastructure
- OpLog (Operation Log) pattern
- Push sync (client → server)
- Pull sync (server → client)
- Cursor-based pagination (500 ops/batch)
- Last-Write-Wins conflict resolution
- Idempotent operations
- Automatic sync every 60 seconds
- Sync on network reconnection
- Sync on tab visibility change

#### Authentication
- User registration with email/password
- Login with credential verification
- Token-based authentication (64-char hex)
- Secure token storage (hashed in database)
- Logout with token revocation
- Auto-login after registration

#### Import/Export
- Export all verses to JSON
- Import verses from JSON with smart ID handling
- Updates existing verses (matching IDs)
- Adds new verses with collision-safe UUIDs (non-matching IDs)
- Preserves all metadata (tags, dates, timestamps)
- Merges imported data with existing data for missing fields
- Clear pre/post-import feedback with counts
- Review history preserved during updates

#### Backend API
- PHP 8.0+ with strict types
- SQLite database with WAL mode
- RESTful API endpoints:
  - POST /api/register
  - POST /api/login
  - POST /api/logout
  - POST /api/push
  - GET /api/pull
- CORS support for development
- Prepared statements for security
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Token hashing with SHA-256

#### Database Schema
- Client: 7 IndexedDB tables (verses, reviews, settings, auth, outbox, appliedOps, sync)
- Server: 3 SQLite tables (users, tokens, ops)
- Derived views for current state (verses_view, reviews_view, user_stats)
- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1.5: Authentication UI (Complete ✅)

**Status:** Implementation Complete, Testing in Progress  
**Completed:** January 6, 2025  
**Goal:** Add optional authentication with smart prompts for multi-device sync

#### Core Features
- [x] Authentication state management in app
- [x] Persistent auth banner (anonymous and authenticated states)
- [x] Authentication modal (login/register forms)
- [x] Data migration on signup (sync local verses to server)
- [x] Sync status indicator in banner
- [x] Modified sync behavior (only sync when authenticated)
- ⏭️ Strategic prompts (deferred - optional enhancement)
- ⏭️ Account menu in header (covered by banner)

#### User Experience
- [x] App works fully without authentication (local-only mode)
- [x] Users can add/edit/review verses immediately
- [x] Banner encourages signup (not dismissible - always visible)
- [x] Seamless migration of local data on signup
- [x] Clear sync status indicators in banner
- [x] Logout preserves local data

#### Technical Implementation
- [x] Add auth state to Alpine.js app
- [x] Build auth banner component (two states)
- [x] Build auth modal with forms (login/register toggle)
- [x] Add data migration function
- [x] Update sync.ts to check authentication
- [x] Style all components with glass-morphism
- [x] **Bug Fix:** Fixed API routing (removed .php extensions)
- ⏭️ Strategic prompt logic (deferred)
- ⏭️ localStorage tracking for prompts (deferred)

#### Testing
- [ ] Anonymous user flow (use without auth) - **In Progress**
- [ ] Authentication flow (login/register) - **In Progress**
- [ ] Data migration (local verses sync on signup)
- [ ] Authenticated user flow (sync, logout)
- [ ] Multi-device sync
- [ ] Edge cases (offline, token expiry, errors)

#### Bug Fixes
- [x] **API Routing Issue** - Client was calling `/api/register.php` but server expected `/api/register`
  - **Solution:** Updated client to use RESTful URLs (removed .php extensions)
  - **Files Changed:** `client/src/sync.ts`
  - **Rationale:** Modern convention, future-proof, cleaner API design

## Current Status

### Version
**1.0.0-alpha** - Phase 1 Incomplete

### Production Readiness
⚠️ **NOT Ready for Production**
- Phase 1 features partially implemented
- **Authentication UI missing** - users cannot log in or register
- **Sync untested** - no way to test multi-device sync without auth UI
- Backend complete, frontend incomplete
- Manual testing incomplete (auth flows not testable)
- Documentation comprehensive

### Known Issues
**Critical:**
1. **No Authentication UI** - Cannot log in, register, or logout from the app
   - Backend endpoints exist and work
   - Sync functions exist in code
   - But no UI to access these features
   - Impact: App is local-only, no multi-device sync possible
   - Solution: Implement Phase 1.5 (Authentication UI)

**Non-Critical:**
See Technical Debt section below.

## Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **Bundle Size** - Tailwind CSS from CDN is 3.5MB (not purged)
   - Impact: Slower initial load on slow connections
   - Solution: Bundle and purge in Phase 2
   
2. **No Automated Tests** - Manual testing only
   - Impact: Risk of regressions, time-consuming testing
   - Solution: Add Vitest + Playwright in Phase 2

3. **No Pagination** - Verse list loads all verses
   - Impact: Could be slow with 1000+ verses
   - Solution: Add virtual scrolling or pagination

### Medium Priority
4. **TypeScript Any Types** - Some implicit any types remain
   - Impact: Reduced type safety in some areas
   - Solution: Gradually add explicit types

5. **Error Messages** - Could be more user-friendly
   - Impact: Users may not understand errors
   - Solution: Improve error handling and messages

6. **No Rate Limiting** - API endpoints unprotected
   - Impact: Potential abuse in production
   - Solution: Add rate limiting middleware

### Low Priority
7. **No CSRF Protection** - Token-based API only
   - Impact: Minimal for personal app
   - Solution: Add CSRF tokens if needed

8. **No Logging** - No server-side logging
   - Impact: Harder to debug production issues
   - Solution: Add structured logging

9. **No Monitoring** - No performance monitoring
   - Impact: Can't track production issues
   - Solution: Add monitoring service

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Integration Specification)
- Merge three reference implementations
- Use Vue.js 3 for reactivity (migrated from Alpine.js January 2025)
- Use Dexie.js for offline storage
- Use OpLog pattern for sync
- Use SQLite for simplicity

### Phase 1 Clarifications
- Manual refSort entry (auto-parsing deferred)
- Per-session probability (not per-day)
- Token hashing in database
- Vue.js 3 for scalability and TypeScript integration
- Manual testing only

### Implementation Adjustments
- Added reviews_view during review (was missing)
- Kept probability per-session (simpler than per-day)
- No .env file (hardcoded paths acceptable for Phase 1)
- No seed script (deferred to later)

### Lessons Learned
- OpLog pattern works excellently for sync
- IndexedDB provides reliable offline storage
- Vue.js 3 provides excellent scalability and TypeScript integration
- Tailwind CSS speeds up development significantly
- TypeScript catches many bugs early
- Manual testing is time-consuming but thorough
- Single File Components improve code organization significantly
